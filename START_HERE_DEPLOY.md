## 📝 Follow These Steps (15 minutes total)

### **STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository** (2 minutes)

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://github.com**
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right corner)
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `mango-pesticide-detector`
   - **Description:** "ML-powered mango pesticide detection app using CNN, SVM, and Random Forest"
   - **Visibility:** ✅ **PUBLIC** (required for free hosting)
   - ❌ **DON'T** check "Add README"
   - ❌ **DON'T** check "Add .gitignore"
5. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### **STEP 2: Push Your Code to GitHub** (1 minute)

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Copy them and run:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\rakes\Desktop\perfect project\mango-pesticide-detector"

# Add your GitHub repo (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mango-pesticide-detector.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

**Result:** Your code is now on GitHub! 🎉

### **STEP 3: Deploy Backend on Render** (7 minutes)

#### 3.1 Sign Up for Render
1. Go to: **https://render.com**
2. Click **"Get Started for Free"**
3. Sign up with your **GitHub account** (easiest)
4. Authorize Render to access GitHub

#### 3.2 Create Web Service
1. Click **"New +"** (top right)
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Click **"Connect account"** if you haven't already
4. Find and select your **`mango-pesticide-detector`** repository
5. Click **"Connect"**

#### 3.3 Configure Backend
Fill in these settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Name** | `mango-backend` (or any name you like) |
| **Region** | Choose closest to you |
| **Root Directory** | `server` |
| **Environment** | `Python 3` |
| **Build Command** | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Start Command** | `gunicorn wsgi:app` |
| **Instance Type** | `Free` |

#### 3.4 Deploy!
1. Click **"Create Web Service"**
2. Wait 5-10 minutes (Render will install TensorFlow and other dependencies)
3. Watch the logs - you'll see:
   - Installing packages...
   - Building...
   - Deploy succeeded!
4. **IMPORTANT:** Copy your backend URL from the top
   - It looks like: `https://mango-backend-xxxxx.onrender.com`
   - Save it! You'll need it in the next step

**Result:** Your backend is live! 🚀

---

### **STEP 4: Build Frontend** (2 minutes)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\rakes\Desktop\perfect project\mango-pesticide-detector\client"
npm run build
```

Wait for it to complete. You'll see:
```
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully!
```

**Result:** `client/build` folder is created ✅

---

### **STEP 5: Deploy Frontend on Netlify** (3 minutes)

#### 5.1 Sign Up for Netlify
1. Go to: **https://netlify.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Sign up with **GitHub** (or email)

#### 5.2 Deploy Your Site
1. In Netlify dashboard, look for **"Sites"** section
2. **Drag and drop** the entire `client/build` folder onto the page
   - The folder is at: `c:\Users\rakes\Desktop\perfect project\mango-pesticide-detector\client\build`
3. Netlify will upload and deploy (takes ~30 seconds)
4. Your site is now live! But wait, we need to configure it...

#### 5.3 Configure Environment Variable
1. Click on your site name
2. Go to **"Site settings"** (top nav)
3. Click **"Environment variables"** (left sidebar)
4. Click **"Add a variable"**
5. Enter:
   - **Key:** `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api` (paste your Render URL from Step 3)
6. Click **"Create variable"**

#### 5.4 Redeploy with Environment Variable
1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab (top nav)
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
3. Wait ~30 seconds

**Result:** Your app is fully deployed! 🎊

---

## ✨ YOU'RE LIVE!

Your Mango Pesticide Detector is now deployed and accessible worldwide!

### 🌐 Your URLs

- **Frontend (Netlify):** `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Backend (Render):** `https://mango-backend-xxxxx.onrender.com`

### 🧪 Test Your Deployment

1. Open your Netlify URL in a browser
2. Wait for the green health badge (backend might take 30s to wake up)
3. Upload a mango image
4. See the prediction and comparison chart!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Render Free Tier:** Backend sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - First request takes ~30 seconds to "wake up"
  - This is normal - don't worry!
- **Netlify Free Tier:** No limitations for static sites
  - Always fast!

### Model Files
Your model files (`.h5`, `.pkl`) are included in your GitHub repo. If they're too large (>100MB), you might need to:
1. Use **Git LFS** (Large File Storage)
2. Or upload them manually to Render after deployment

### Update Your README
Add your live URLs to the README.md file so others can see your deployed app!

---

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### Demo Script
1. "This is my deployed Mango Pesticide Detector"
2. Show the UI and upload an organic mango
3. Explain the 3-model comparison (CNN, SVM, Random Forest)
4. Show the inline chart and detailed comparison page
5. Upload a non-mango image to show validation
6. Explain the deployment architecture (Render + Netlify)

### Architecture Diagram
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend not responding
- **Problem:** Frontend shows "Backend offline"
- **Solution:** Go to your Render dashboard and check logs. First request takes ~30s to wake up.

### CORS errors
- **Problem:** Browser console shows CORS error
- **Solution:** 
  1. Go to Render dashboard
  2. Environment → Add variable
  3. Key: `CORS_ORIGINS`, Value: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app`
  4. Redeploy

### Frontend shows old code
- **Problem:** Changes not visible
- **Solution:** 
  1. Rebuild: `npm run build`
  2. Re-upload `build` folder to Netlify
  3. Clear cache in Netlify
